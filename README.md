# Red-vs-Blue-Project
In this project my and my fellow classmates were tasked with hacking into a victim machine and then reading the logs and providing mitigations against future hacking attempts. The three machines (The attacker, the victim, and the Kibana server) all exist within Microsoft Azure.
